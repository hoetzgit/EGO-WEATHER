## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rpi-weather-dashboard.git
cd rpi-weather-dashboard
```

---

### 2. Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3. Configure the dashboard

Edit configuration files inside:

```
config/
```

Typical configuration includes:

* Coordinates (latitude / longitude)
* Nearby locations list
* API provider settings
* Update intervals

---

### 4. Run data fetch scripts

Example:

```bash
python scripts/fetch_nearby_places.py
```

You can schedule scripts using `cron` for periodic updates.

---

### 5. Open the dashboard

Serve the `dashboard/` folder via:

* Nginx / Apache
  or
* Simple HTTP server:

```bash
cd dashboard
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open:

```
http://<raspberry-ip>:8080
```

---

## 📍 Nearby Locations

The dashboard supports multiple nearby locations (up to 6 by default), showing:

* Temperature
* Weather conditions
* Wind speed
* Humidity
* Distance from main station

Locations are defined in the configuration and resolved via API.

---

## 📊 Data Sources

* Local weather station via **WeeWX**
* External APIs (e.g. Xweather) for:

  * Forecast
  * Nearby conditions
  * Radar layers

---


## 🛠️ Customization

You can easily customize:

* UI styles (CSS)
* Layout of tiles
* Number of nearby locations
* Data sources / APIs
* Units (metric / imperial)

---

## 📌 Notes

* Designed primarily for **Raspberry Pi dashboards**
* Works well on tablets (e.g. iPad wall display)
* Optimized for local network usage
